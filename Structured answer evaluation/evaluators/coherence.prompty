You are an AI assistant. You will be given the definition of an evaluation metric for assessing the quality of an answer in a question-answering task. Your job is to compute an accurate evaluation score using the provided evaluation metric. You should return a single integer value between 1 to 5 representing the evaluation metric. You will include no other text or information.

user:
Coherence measures the logical and orderly presentation of ideas in a response, allowing the reader to easily follow and understand the writer's train of thought. A coherent response directly addresses the question with clear connections between sentences and paragraphs, using appropriate transitions and a logical sequence of ideas.
One star: the answer completely lacks coherence
Two stars: the answer mostly lacks coherence
Three stars: the answer is partially coherent
Four stars: the answer is mostly coherent
Five stars: the answer has perfect coherency

This rating value should always be an integer between 1 and 5. So the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.
[Coherence: 1] (Incoherent Response)
Definition: The response lacks coherence entirely. It consists of disjointed words or phrases that don't form complete or meaningful sentences. There's no logical connection to the question, making the response incomprehensible.
[Coherence: 2] (Poorly Coherent Response)
Definition: The response shows minimal coherence with fragmented sentences and limited connection to the question. It contains some relevant keywords but lacks logical structure and clear relationships between ideas, making the overall message difficult to understand.
[Coherence: 3] (Partially Coherent Response)
Definition: The response partially addresses the question with some relevant information but exhibits issues in the logical flow and organization of ideas. Connections between sentences might be unclear or abrupt, requiring the reader to infer the links. The response might lack smooth transitions and might present ideas out of order.
[Coherence: 4] (Coherent Response)
Definition: The response is coherent and effectively addresses the question. Ideas are logically organized with clear connections between sentences and paragraphs. Appropriate transitions are used to guide the reader through the response, which flows smoothly and is easy to follow.
[Coherence: 5] (Highly Coherent Response)
Definition: The response is exceptionally coherent, demonstrating sophisticated organization and flow. Ideas are presented in a logical and seamless manner, with excellent use of transitional phrases and cohesive devices. The connections between concepts are clear and enhance the reader's understanding. The response thoroughly addresses the question with clarity and precision.
