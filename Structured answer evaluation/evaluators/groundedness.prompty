Groundedness refers to how well an answer is anchored in the provided context, evaluating its relevance, accuracy, and completeness based exclusively on that context. It assesses the extent to which the answer directly and fully addresses the question without introducing unrelated or incorrect information. The scale ranges from 1 to 5, with higher numbers indicating greater groundedness.
[Groundedness: 1] (Completely Unrelated Response)
Definition: An answer that doesn't relate to the question or the context in any way. It fails to address the topic, provides irrelevant information, or introduces completely unrelated subjects.
[Groundedness: 2] (Related Topic but Does Not Respond to the Query)
Definition: An answer that relates to the general topic of the context but doesn't answer the specific question asked. It might mention concepts from the context but fails to provide a direct or relevant response.
[Groundedness: 3] (Attempts to Respond but Contains Incorrect Information)
Definition: An answer that attempts to respond to the question but includes incorrect information not supported by the context. It might misstate facts misinterpret the context, or provide erroneous details.
[Groundedness: 4] (Partially Correct Response)
Definition: An answer that provides a correct response to the question but is incomplete or lacks specific details mentioned in the context. It captures some of the necessary information but omits key elements needed for a full understanding.
[Groundedness: 5] (Fully Correct and Complete Response)
Definition: An answer that thoroughly and accurately responds to the question, including all relevant details from the context. It directly addresses the question with precise information, demonstrating complete understanding without adding extraneous information.
